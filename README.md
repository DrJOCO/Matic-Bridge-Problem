# Matic-Bridge-Problem
Tokens stuck, please help

I do not know where else to go for help. This is the issue I am running into and need help. I lost a lot of money for me if my funds are stuck in the matic bridge.

Below are the steps of what happened.

1. I connected my polygon wallet to the brige https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/ 

2. Initiated the withdrawal (https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xfc45079657ad5ab3b982f8f670ae456a945097a1dfb1a530565c0ffea9dd02f8) which completed. So now my GAMEE is burned. However, on the bridge website my withdrawal remained 0/2 and was never 'initialized'. It did not have an associated transaction hash.

3. I went to https://polygon-withdraw.matic.network/ , connected to my ETH wallet, and input the transaction hash: 0xfc45079657ad5ab3b982f8f670ae456a945097a1dfb1a530565c0ffea9dd02f8 (from my completed polygon transaction which burned by tokens)

4. After pressing “complete withdraw” it does not go through. Instead, it says “invalid response.”

Can you please take a look and let me know what happened? 

Thank you.
